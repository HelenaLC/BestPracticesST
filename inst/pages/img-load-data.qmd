# Load imaging-based data {#sec-img-load-data}

## Overview

In this chapter, we load spatial transcriptomics datasets from imaging-based platforms (10x Genomics Xenium, Vizgen MERSCOPE, and/or NanoString CosMx), which will be used in the examples in the following chapters.

For details on the technological platforms, see @sec-bkg-bioconductor-data-classes.
