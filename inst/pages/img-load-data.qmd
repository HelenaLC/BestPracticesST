# Load data {#sec-img-load-data}

## Introduction

In this chapter, we load one or more datasets from the commercially available imaging-based spatial transcriptomics platforms (10x Genomics Xenium, Vizgen MERSCOPE, and NanoString CosMx), which will be used in the examples in the following chapters.

For details on the technological platforms, see @sec-bkg-spatial-transcriptomics.
