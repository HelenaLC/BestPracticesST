## Link to book

The development version of the book is available at: https://lmweber.org/BestPracticesST/


## Building the book

To make changes and publish an updated version of the book, first manually commit and push any changes to files that are located outside the `inst/` directory, and then use the following code using the `BiocBook` package to commit and publish changes to files in `inst/` (e.g. `inst/assets/_book.yml` and `inst/pages/chapter-name.qmd` if adding a new chapter):

```
library(BiocBook)
bb <- BiocBook(".")
publish(bb, message = "commit message")
```

To compile and preview the book locally:

```
library(BiocBook)
bb <- BiocBook(".")
preview(bb)
```


## BiocBook

The book is built using the [BiocBook](https://github.com/js2264/BiocBook) package, developed by [Jacques Serizay](https://jserizay.com/) for building Quarto books with Bioconductor. For more details on building a book with BiocBook, see the [BiocBook book](https://jserizay.com/BiocBookDemo/devel/).
